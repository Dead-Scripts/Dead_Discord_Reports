### DiscordReports

What is it?

    DiscordReports is a script I made way back in August of 2019, but I never actually got around to releasing it. I know there is another discord report script on the forums made by my old good friend @ApolloCore which you can find below. However, my script is a little different in the way it works and has some quite unique features I thought would be useful. So therefore in my quest to become the #1 open source developer on GitHub, I am releasing it today for your use cases. Jokes aside, it's a really cool and nifty script that can really help you staffing your server.

### Installation

    You will need to find the configuration section within the server.lua

    You will see the below block of code

    You can choose to put displayIdentifiers as true or false

        Refer to above Images of what this will do

    You also need to set up the webhookURL for where the script will post the reports within Discord

    You will need to give your staff group's the permission BadgerReports.See in order to see the action reports within the server
